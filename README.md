## The Highway Bug Game
Welcome to The Highway Bug Game. A throwback to the classic arcade game, Frogger.

## How to Play
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Use your arrow keys to move the player.
3. If you collide with an enemy bug, your player will reset to starting position.
4. If you try to move outside of the game’s canvas, your player will reset to the starting position.
5. If you reach the water without going out of bounds and not colliding with an enemy bug, you win!
6. Click OK or hit the <return> key to play again.

### Objective
Help your player across the road avoiding the enemy bugs along the way. Reach the water without being touched to win!

### Rules
Use the arrow keys to move and cross the road. Be careful not to collide with any enemy bugs though or you'll have to start over! Also, stay inside the dimensions of the game's canvas…you have to start over if you move outside the walls!

Good luck!
