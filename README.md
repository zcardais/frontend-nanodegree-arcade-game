# HIGHWAY BUG GAME
Welcome to Highway Bug, my take on the classic arcade game Frogger.

## HOW TO PLAY
Help your player across the road avoiding the enemy bugs along the way. Use the arrow keys to move and cross the road. Be careful not to collide with any bugs though or you'll have to start over! Get to the water without being touched to win. Good luck!
